## What is Mercury?

Mercury is a integrated learning platform for computer architecture and other
low-level computer systems. The project consists of two main components: the
Engine, that powers the simulation, and the Editor, a user-friendly IDE.

## Engine

The Engine is a collection of multiple simulators capable of simulating an 
entire computer. Uses a modular and extensible architecture, allowing for easy
implementation of new architectures and simulators. Also, currently supports any static
ELF executable, allowing students to run real-world programs.

Architectures currently supported:
* **MIPS:** the entire MIPS-I ISA is supported, with support for some instructions
found in later revisions of the ISA.
* **RISC-V:** not currently supported. Planned for future releases after support
for MIPS is stable.

## Editor

The Editor is an IDE that interfaces with the simulators provided by the Engine.
It provides a user-friendly interface for students to write, compile, and run
assembly code. Also has a integrated quick guide of basic concepts of computer
architecture and assembly programming.
